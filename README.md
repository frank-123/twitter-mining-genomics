# Twitter Mining

This is a repository for example code for mining of tweets wrt. genomics, genetics and personalized medicine.

The folder contains some KNIME workflows for downloading the tweets via the free Twitter API and for the analysis of the selected tweets.

The subfolder *D3-webpages* shows he example code for some webpages based on the D3 and jQuery libraries. Please take into account that these are just  my first experiences with Javascript.
